# CogNote

I built this for my own needs because no other app had what I wanted. It is a PDF annotator for laptop: free, unlimited edits, pen, highlighter, shapes, and export. Open PDFs, mark them up, save or export.

**Use it:** [https://chaitanyak77.github.io/CogNote/](https://chaitanyak77.github.io/CogNote/)

**Run locally:** `npm install` then `npm run dev` and open the URL shown in the terminal.

**Privacy:** Your PDFs and annotations never leave your device. Nothing is sent to any server or stored online. Everything stays in your browser (memory and local storage like IndexedDB).

**Caution:** On a shared or public computer, anyone with access can see your open tabs and any data this app has stored for that browser. Use only on your own device if your PDFs are sensitive. To remove stored PDFs and annotations, clear this site’s data in your browser (e.g. site settings > clear data, or clear browsing data for this origin).
