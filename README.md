# CogNote

I built this for my own needs because no other app had what I wanted. It is a PDF annotator for laptop: free, unlimited edits, pen, highlighter, shapes, and export. Open PDFs, mark them up, save or export.

**Use it:** [https://chaitanyak77.github.io/CogNote/](https://chaitanyak77.github.io/CogNote/)

**Run locally:** `npm install` then `npm run dev` and open the URL shown in the terminal.
